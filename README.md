# Neural-Style-Transferring
  Basically, transferring the style content of one desired image to our input image is neural-style-transfer. Just like   painting a Masterpiece but with CNN rather than a brush :)

# DAY: 01
        started Reading about style transfer..from medium : https://medium.com/tensorflow/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398
        There is a paper written on neural style transfer by Leon A. Gatys :https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf
        
# DAY: 02
    Try to understand loss functions:-
    1>content loss/  
    2>style loss/  
    *watch Andrew Ng lectures on style transfer*.
  
# DAY: 03
    Understand why we are using middle layers and not the first and last layers. 
    select content and style layers.
# DAY: 04
    Read about the dimesion flow of tensor...It will help you to write code.
